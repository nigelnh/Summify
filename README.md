## 💭 Personal Note
As a student constantly reading research papers and academic articles, I found myself spending too much time trying to determine which papers were relevant to my research. Simmify was born from this need - a tool that could quickly give me the essence of an article while maintaining the fun, retro aesthetic I love. The pixel art theme serves as a refreshing break from the typically serious academic tools, making the research process more enjoyable.
